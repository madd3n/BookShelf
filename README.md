# BookShelf

Buttons:
  - **Load images**: Will load all files in the "Images/" directory on the root of the project
  - **Load Music**: Will load all files in the "Music/" directory on the root of the project

Logic:
  All files that are loaded will be shown in a scrollable view and will be pressable.
  For the music we will be able to listen to any loaded song and control the volume
  For images we will be able to open the image
